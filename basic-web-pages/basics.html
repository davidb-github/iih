     <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
       <p>
         First, we need to learn some basic HTML
       </p>

     <h2>Lists</h2>
       <p>
         This is what an ordered list looks like:
       </p>

     <ol>
       <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list) </li>
       <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
       <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
     </ol>

     <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
       <p><em>Sometimes</em>,you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
       <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
       <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</p></em></strong>
